 * Sent Email settings available in craft/config/sprout.php
 *
 * This file does nothing on its own. It provides documentation of the
 * default value for each config setting and provides an example of how to
 * override each setting in 'craft/config/sprout.php`
 *
 * To override default settings, copy the settings you wish to implement to
 * your 'craft/config/sprout.php' config file and make your changes there.
 *
 * Config settings files are multi-environment aware so you can have different
 * settings groups for each environment, just as you do for 'general.php'
